# The compression algorithms are:
# ALGO_INTERP_LORENZO
#     The default algorithm in SZ3. It is the implementation of our ICDE'21 paper.
#     The whole dataset will be compressed by interpolation or lorenzo predictor with auto-optimized settings.
# ALGO_INTERP
#     The whole dataset will be compressed by interpolation predictor with default settings.
# ALGO_LORENZO_REG
#     The whole dataset will be compressed by lorenzo and/or regression based predictors block by block with default settings.
#     The four predictors ( 1st-order lorenzo, 2nd-order lorenzo, 1st-order regression, 2nd-order regression)
#     can be enabled or disabled independently by conf settings (Lorenzo, Lorenzo2ndOrder, Regression, Regression2ndOrder).

#errorBoundMode: 6 options to control different types of error bounds
# "ABS", "REL", "PSNR", "NORM", "ABS_AND_REL", "ABS_OR_REL"
#ErrorBoundMode = ABS

#absolute Error Bound (NOTE: it's valid when errorBoundMode is related to ABS (i.e., absolute error bound)
#absErrBound is to limit the (de)compression errors to be within an absolute error.
#For example, absErrBound=0.0001 means the decompressed value must be in [V-0.0001,V+0.0001], where V is the original true value.
#AbsErrorBound = 1

#relative Bound Ratio (NOTE: it's valid only when errorBoundMode is related to REL (i.e., value_range based relative error bound)
#relErrBound is to limit the (de)compression errors by considering the global data value range size (i.e., taking into account the range size (max_value - min_value)).
#For example, suppose relBoundRatio is set to 0.01, and the data set is {100,101,102,103,104,...,110},
#so the global value range size is 110-100=10, so the error bound will actually be 10*0.01=0.1, from the perspective of "relBoundRatio"
#RelErrorBound = 1e-3

#expected PSNR (Note: only valid when ErrorBoundMode = PSNR)
#PSNRErrorBound = 70

#expected L2 NORM Error: sqrt((x1-x1')^2+(x2-x2')^2+....+(xN-xN')^2)
#L2NormErrorBound = .333

# The target for parameter autotuning. Current supports: TUNING_TARGET_CR (best compression ratio), TUNING_TARGET_RD (best rate distortion), TUNING_TARGET_SSIM (best rate-ssim).

#Setting for auto-tuning parameters.

#Alpha and beta are parameters for autotuning. If autoTuningRate>0, they will be automatically selected in compression. If autoTuningRate=0, will use given alpha and beta. 
#alpha=-1 and beta=-1 is the default SZ3.
#alpha=2 and beta=3 is the recommended fixed parameter set for the new RTM dataset (set autoTuningRate=0 when using them).

#maximum quantization interval is valid only when quantization_intervals=0 (i.e., let the sz compressor optimize the intervals)
#In general, this setting does not change the compression ratio/rate, but only affect the compression speed to a certain extent (only 10% in general).
#The high values of max_quant_intervals, the lower compression speed,
#but the higher ability the compressor can reach high compression ratios for high-precision compression.
#As for low-precision compression (i.e., high error bound such as 1E-2), max_quant_intervals could be set to 256 or 65536.
#As for pretty-high-precision demand (i.e., fairly small error bound such as 1E-6), max_quant_intervals could be set to 2097152(=2^21).
